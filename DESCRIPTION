Description: This package estimates the strength of mate preference and the strength of phenotypic offset between trait values in mated pairs of organisms, as well as means and standard deviations from X and Y normally distributed phenotypic traits. The package uses a likelihood function defined by the authors that is maximized using the built-in function optim(). The package computes maximum likelihood estimates, the log-likelihood, and a Hessian matrix, and returns parameter estimates and the standard errors for these estimates.
